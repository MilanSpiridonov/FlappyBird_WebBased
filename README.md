# FlappyBird_WebBased
A carbon copy of Flappy Bird, that works with just a web browser.
It's written on only HTML, CSS and plain JS. (This project cost me my sanity)

It uses the css "left" and "top" attributes and some javascript magic to calculate
movement and the bounding boxes for the collision system.

You can test it out here:

I don't own any of the visuals or the sound effects, the only thing made by me is the code, which is free for 
educational purposes and distribution, as long as you credit me as the author for the source code,
not like I'd be pursuing legal action, but stealing code is a bit of a scummy move :)
